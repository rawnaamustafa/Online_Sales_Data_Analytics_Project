# Online_Sales_Data_Analytics_Project

Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Data Analytics course assignment.
The objective was to practice normalization and visualization using Power BI.

I transformed a raw sales dataset into a Star Schema design. On top of that, I built interactive dashboards and created DAX measures to answer key business questions which i generated using Chatgpt.

Steps Taken

1.Normalization

Normalized tables by separating entities (e.g., Products, Customers, Territories, Status).

Created Fact table (Sales_Fact) and multiple Dimension tables.

Ensured relationships were properly set with primary/foreign keys.

2. Data Modeling

Designed a Star Schema.

3. Dashboarding & Analytics

Built 2 dashboards in Power BI.

Developed custom DAX measures such as:

Total Revenue

Total Quantities Ordered

Average Order Value (AOV)

Average Order Quantity

Expected time for delivery

Actual time for delivery

Used slicers and filters for interactivity.

Key Insights

Bikes category generated the highest revenue of all product categories.

North America is the top-performing territory group.

Canada achieved the highest sales quantities, particularly in Bikes and Clothing categories.

The average actual delivery time was lower than the expected delivery time, suggesting improved delivery efficiency.

Tax amount was highest in the Bikes category.
